For some teams, it’s not that simple. Yes, they still want to win games and win titles, but they are also trying to avoid spending money. This is especially the case with baseball where there is no salary cap or salary floor, which lets teams spend as much or as little as they want on their roster, so some teams spend hundreds of millions of dollars while other teams look at that, know they won’t be able to compete and just settle for spending less than a hundred million and win 60-70 games.\nThis idea of spending as little money while getting as many wins as possible is called “Moneyball” and was revolutionized by the Oakland Athletics in 2002 where they spent $40 million on their roster and won an outstanding 103 games while the top spending team in the league spent $102 million and won five fewer games. Since that season, smaller market teams that know they can’t keep up with the spending habits of the big market teams like the New York Yankees have been trying to replicate what the A’s did in 2002.\nOne team has seemed to do it better than everyone else: the Tampa Bay Rays.\nIn recent years the Rays have been the symbol of “Moneyball” as from 2013 to 2023 they average spending around $68.5 million per year on payroll (league average during that time is around $121.4 million) with an average win percentage of 54.74%. During that span, they also made six postseason appearances (five consecutive from 2019-2023) and made the World Series in 2020 where they lost that series to the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games.\nThe Rays have shown season after season, it’s not all about spending the most money. This is also evident in the 2023 New York Mets where their owner, Steve Cohen, spent over $334 million on one season’s payroll getting the best players on the market, and they ended with a 75-87 record and missed the playoffs.\n\n\nCode\nmlb &lt;- read_csv(\"mlb.csv\")\n\nmlbwpct &lt;- mlb |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    winpct = w/(w+l)*100,\n    payroll = `team payroll` / 1000000\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter(\n    year &gt;= 2013\n  )\n\ntb &lt;- mlbwpct |&gt; \n  filter(team == 'Tampa Bay Rays')\n\nmets &lt;- mlbwpct |&gt; \n  filter(team == 'New York Mets',\n         year == 2023\n         )\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=mlbwpct, aes(x=winpct, y=payroll), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=tb, aes(x=winpct, y=payroll), color=\"#092C5C\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=mets, aes(x=winpct, y=payroll), color=\"#FF5910\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=121.4551) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=50.01908) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=60, y=-15, label=\"Low Payroll, High Wins\")) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=40, y=-15, label=\"Low Payroll, Low Wins\")) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=40, y=250, label=\"High Payroll, Low Wins\")) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=60, y=300, label=\"High Payroll, High Wins\")) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=tb, aes(x= winpct, y=payroll, label= year)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=mets, aes(x=winpct, y=payroll, label=team)) +\n    labs(\n    x=\"Win Percentage\", \n    y=\"Team payroll (in millions)\", \n    title=\"Tampa Bay Rays have found success despite low payroll\", \n    subtitle=\"In the past 10 seasons, the Tampa Bay Rays have never spent more than $77 million on their roster in a seaosn, well below \\nleague average, but have only had four seasons where their win percentage below 50%.\",\n    caption=\"By Trevor Darnell | Source: Baseball Reference\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=9), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, we’ve looked at the Rays’ recent success, but has it just been a short-term flash in the pan or is it more than that?\nWell, from 2000 to 2023 Tampa Bay had 1,879 total wins which ranks fifteenth in the MLB in that period.\nSo, they haven’t won the most, but have they achieved their secondary goal of not spending a ton of money?\nThat is a resounding yes as they have spent the second least amount of money at $1,332,814,453 in that same timeframe.\nThe name of the “Moneyball” game is to spend the least amount of money while getting the most wins. Who’s been the best at that?\nYou would think it would possibly be the team that revolutionized it, the Oakland A’s but that is not the case. The A’s sit at around $764,680 per win, meanwhile the team who has spent the least amount of money per win is the Tampa Bay Rays at $709,321 per win. To put that in perspective, the New York Yankees have spent the most for each win at $2,109,308, which is an almost 200% increase.\nNow is it worth it to spend all that money? Depends on who you ask. If you ask the Rays owners, they will probably say no since they have proven you can still have successful seasons without breaking the bank. On the other hand, the Yankees won two World Series and racked up over 2,100 wins due to spending all that money. It’s just all about perspective.\n\n\nCode\nmlb &lt;- read_csv(\"mlb.csv\")\n\nmoneyball &lt;- mlb |&gt; \n  group_by(team) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    totalwins = sum(w),\n    totalpayroll = sum(`team payroll`)/1000000,\n    spentperwin = totalpayroll/totalwins\n  )\n\n\ntb &lt;- moneyball |&gt; \n  filter(team == 'Tampa Bay Rays')\n\nath &lt;- moneyball |&gt; \n  filter(team == 'Oakland Athletics')\n\nnyy &lt;- moneyball |&gt; \n  filter(team == 'New York Yankees')\n\nthreeclubs &lt;- bind_rows(tb, ath, nyy)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=moneyball, \n    aes(x=totalwins, y=totalpayroll, size=spentperwin), \n    color=\"lightgrey\") + \n      geom_point(\n    data=ath, \n    aes(x=totalwins, y=totalpayroll, size=spentperwin), \n    color=\"#EFB21E\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=tb, \n    aes(x=totalwins, y=totalpayroll, size=spentperwin), \n    color=\"#8FBCE6\") +   \n    geom_point(\n    data=nyy, \n    aes(x=totalwins, y=totalpayroll, size=spentperwin), \n    color=\"#003087\") +  \n   geom_hline(yintercept=2420.578) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=threeclubs, aes(x= totalwins, y=totalpayroll, label= team)) +\n    labs(\n    x=\"Total Wins\", \n    y=\"Total team payroll (in millions)\", \n    size =  \"Money spent per win \\n(in millions)\",\n    title=\"The Rays have perfected the \\\"Moneyball\\\" strategy\",\n    subtitle=\"The Tampa Bay Rays franchise has spent the least amount of money per win than any other team in the MLB since 2000.\",\n    caption=\"By: Trevor Darnell | Source: Baseball Reference\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=9),\n    plot.size = element_text(size=8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is one thing that makes the MLB different from any other major league in America like the NBA and NFL and that’s the minor league system. The MLB thrives on the minor league system and having teams be able to develop and grow a player’s game straight out of high school, so they are ready when it comes time for them to make the major league roster.\nThe Minor League Baseball League (MiLB) is currently made up of five different levels, Rookie, Low-A, High-A, Double-A, and Triple-A. Each MLB franchise has a team in each of these levels that is their affiliate where the franchise can move players up or down depending on their performance.\nThese different leagues are incredibly important for MLB teams’ long-term success, as strong player development allows prospects to make an impact in the majors more quickly. This also enables franchisees to benefit from rookie contracts, which are less expensive, allowing the front office to allocate money to other areas of the team.\nNow, the question is, what franchise has been the best at developing its players?\nThe franchises that have been the most successful at the Triple-A level since 2008 are the New York Yankees (1,276 total wins), Tampa Bay Rays (1,263 total wins), and Oakland A’s (1,237 total wins) in that order. When you think about it the top three do make sense, the Yankees who have the most wins since 2000 because of the combination of development and getting the best players, and two teams that rely on development to obtain wins.\n\n\nCode\nmilb &lt;- read_csv(\"milb.csv\")\n\nmilbtotal &lt;- milb |&gt; \n  arrange(Season) |&gt; \n  group_by(Aff) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    totalwins = sum(W),\n    totallosses = sum(L),\n    winpct = totalwins / (totalwins + totallosses)\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter(winpct &gt;= 0.5118214) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(winpct))\n\n\ndb &lt;- milbtotal |&gt; \n  filter(Aff == \"TBR\")\n\nmilbtotal |&gt;\n  select(Aff, totalwins, totallosses, winpct) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    Aff = \"Franchise\",\n    totalwins = \"Total Wins\",\n    totallosses = \"Toal Losses\",\n    winpct = \"Win Percentage\"\n  ) |&gt; \n   tab_header(\n    title = \"Tampa Bay minor league domination since 2008\",\n    subtitle = \"To sustain success at the MLB level it helps to have success at the minor league level and develop players to be ready to play in the majors.\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n    tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Trevor Darnell  |  **Source:** Baseball Reference\")\n  ) |&gt; \n    tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=18)\n     )\n   ) |&gt; \n    opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt; \n        fmt_percent(\n    columns = c(winpct),\n    decimals = 2\n  ) |&gt; \n    tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#092C5C\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"#8FBCE6\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Aff == \"TBR\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTampa Bay minor league domination since 2008\n\n\nTo sustain success at the MLB level it helps to have success at the minor league level and develop players to be ready to play in the majors.\n\n\nFranchise\nTotal Wins\nToal Losses\nWin Percentage\n\n\n\n\nNYY\n1276\n1007\n55.89%\n\n\nTBR\n1263\n1030\n55.08%\n\n\nOAK\n1237\n1049\n54.11%\n\n\nLAD\n1210\n1076\n52.93%\n\n\nCLE\n1197\n1089\n52.36%\n\n\nARI\n1193\n1092\n52.21%\n\n\nHOU\n1188\n1101\n51.90%\n\n\nPIT\n1180\n1109\n51.55%\n\n\nSTL\n1176\n1110\n51.44%\n\n\nMIL\n1167\n1105\n51.36%\n\n\n\nBy: Trevor Darnell | Source: Baseball Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, success in the MLB depends on the franchise you are talking about. Some teams like the Tampa Bay Rays have made a name for themselves by creating teams that don’t like to spend money and ship off players when they are about to reach a big payday but do still win games and aren’t strangers to making the playoffs."
