    "text": "Every sports team has the same goal, to win as many games as possible. For some teams it’s not that simple. Yes, they still want to win games and win titles, but they are also trying to avoid spending money. This is especially the case with baseball where there is no salary cap or salary floor, which lets teams spend as much or as little as they want on their roster, so some teams spend hundreds of millions of dollars while other teams look at that, know they won’t really be able to compete and just settle for spending less than a hundred million and win 60-70 games.\nThis idea of spending as little money while getting as many wins as possible is called “Moneyball” and was revolutionized by the Oakland Athletics in 2002 where they spent $40 million on their roster and won an outstanding 103 games while the top spending team in the league spent $102 million and won five less games. Ever since that season smaller market teams that know they can’t keep up with the spending habits of the big market teams like the New York Yankees have been trying replicate what the A’s did in 2002.\nOne team has seemed to do it better than everyone else: the Tampa Bay Rays.\nIn recent years the Rays have been the symbol of “Moneyball” as from 2013 to 2023 they average spending around $68.5 million per year on payroll (league average during that time is around $121.4 million) with an average win percentage of 54.74%. During that span they also made six postseason appearances (five consecutive from 2019-2023) and made the World Series in 2020 where they lost that series to the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games.\nThe Rays have shown season after season, it’s not all about spending the most money. This is also evident in the 2023 New York Mets where their owner, Steve Cohen, spent over $334 million on one season’s payroll getting the best players that were on the market, and they ended with a 75-87 record and missed the playoffs.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\nmlb &lt;- read_csv(\"mlb.csv\")\n\nmlbwpct &lt;- mlb |&gt;
