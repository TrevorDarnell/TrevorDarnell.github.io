For some teams, it’s not that simple. Yes, they still want to win games and win titles, but they are also trying to avoid spending money. This is especially the case with baseball where there is no salary cap or salary floor, which lets teams spend as much or as little as they want on their roster, so some teams spend hundreds of millions of dollars while other teams look at that, know they won’t be able to compete and just settle for spending less than a hundred million and win 60-70 games.\nThis idea of spending as little money while getting as many wins as possible is called “Moneyball” and was revolutionized by the Oakland Athletics in 2002 where they spent $40 million on their roster and won an outstanding 103 games while the top spending team in the league spent $102 million and won five fewer games. Since that season, smaller market teams that know they can’t keep up with the spending habits of the big market teams like the New York Yankees have been trying to replicate what the A’s did in 2002.\nOne team has seemed to do it better than everyone else: the Tampa Bay Rays.\nIn recent years the Rays have been the symbol of “Moneyball” as from 2013 to 2023 they average spending around $68.5 million per year on payroll (league average during that time is around $121.4 million) with an average win percentage of 54.74%. During that span, they also made six postseason appearances (five consecutive from 2019-2023) and made the World Series in 2020 where they lost that series to the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games.\nThe Rays have shown season after season, it’s not all about spending the most money. This is also evident in the 2023 New York Mets where their owner, Steve Cohen, spent over $334 million on one season’s payroll getting the best players on the market, and they ended with a 75-87 record and missed the playoffs.\n\n\nCode\nmlb &lt;- read_csv(\"mlb.csv\")\n\nmlbwpct &lt;- mlb |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    winpct = w/(w+l)*100,\n    payroll = `team payroll` / 1000000\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter(\n    year &gt;= 2013\n  )\n\ntb &lt;- mlbwpct |&gt; \n  filter(team == 'Tampa Bay Rays')\n\nmets &lt;- mlbwpct |&gt; \n  filter(team == 'New York Mets',\n         year == 2023\n         )\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=mlbwpct, aes(x=winpct, y=payroll), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=tb, aes(x=winpct, y=payroll), color=\"#092C5C\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=mets, aes(x=winpct, y=payroll), color=\"#FF5910\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=121.4551) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=50.01908) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=60, y=-15, label=\"Low Payroll, High Wins\")) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=40, y=-15, label=\"Low Payroll, Low Wins\")) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=40, y=250, label=\"High Payroll, Low Wins\")) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=60, y=300, label=\"High Payroll, High Wins\")) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=tb, aes(x= winpct, y=payroll, label= year)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=mets, aes(x=winpct, y=payroll, label=team)) +\n    labs(\n    x=\"Win Percentage\", \n    y=\"Team payroll (in millions)\", \n    title=\"Tampa Bay Rays have found success despite low payroll\", \n    subtitle=\"In the past 10 seasons, the Tampa Bay Rays have never spent more than $77 million on their roster in a seaosn, well below \\nleague average, but have only had four seasons where their win percentage below 50%.\",\n    caption=\"By Trevor Darnell | Source: Baseball Reference\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=9), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, we’ve looked at the Rays’ recent success, but has it just been a short-term flash in the pan or is it more than that?\nWell, from 2000 to 2023 Tampa Bay had 1,879 total wins which ranks fifteenth in the MLB in that period.\nSo, they haven’t won the most, but have they achieved their secondary goal of not spending a ton of money?\nThat is a resounding yes as they have spent the second least amount of money at $1,332,814,453 in that same timeframe.\nThe name of the “Moneyball” game is to spend the least amount of money while getting the most wins. Who’s been the best at that?\nYou would think it would possibly be the team that revolutionized it, the Oakland A’s but that is not the case. The A’s sit at around $764,680 per win, meanwhile the team who has spent the least amount of money per win is the Tampa Bay Rays at $709,321 per win. To put that in perspective, the New York Yankees have spent the most for each win at $2,109,308, which is an almost 200% increase.\nNow is it worth it to spend all that money? Depends on who you ask. If you ask the Rays owners, they will probably say no since they have proven you can still have successful seasons without breaking the bank. On the other hand, the Yankees won two World Series and racked up over 2,100 wins due to spending all that money. It’s just all about perspective.\n\n\nCode\nmlb &lt;- read_csv(\"mlb.csv\")\n\nmoneyball &lt;- mlb |&gt; \n  group_by(team) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    totalwins = sum(w),\n    totalpayroll = sum(`team payroll`)/1000000,\n    spentperwin = totalpayroll/totalwins\n  )\n\n\ntb &lt;- moneyball |&gt; \n  filter(team == 'Tampa Bay Rays')\n\nath &lt;- moneyball |&gt; \n  filter(team == 'Oakland Athletics')\n\nnyy &lt;- moneyball |&gt; \n  filter(team == 'New York Yankees')\n\nthreeclubs &lt;- bind_rows(tb, ath, nyy)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=moneyball, \n    aes(x=totalwins, y=totalpayroll, size=spentperwin), \n    color=\"lightgrey\") + \n      geom_point(\n    data=ath, \n    aes(x=totalwins, y=totalpayroll, size=spentperwin), \n    color=\"#EFB21E\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=tb, \n    aes(x=totalwins, y=totalpayroll, size=spentperwin), \n    color=\"#8FBCE6\") +   \n    geom_point(\n    data=nyy, \n    aes(x=totalwins, y=totalpayroll, size=spentperwin), \n    color=\"#003087\") +  \n   geom_hline(yintercept=2420.578) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=threeclubs, aes(x= totalwins, y=totalpayroll, label= team)) +\n    labs(\n    x=\"Total Wins\", \n    y=\"Total team payroll (in millions)\", \n    size =  \"Money spent per win \\n(in millions)\",\n    title=\"The Rays have perfected the \\\"Moneyball\\\" strategy\",\n    subtitle=\"The Tampa Bay Rays franchise has spent the least amount of money per win than any other team in the MLB since 2000.\",\n    caption=\"By: Trevor Darnell | Source: Baseball Reference\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=9),\n    plot.size = element_text(size=8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is one thing that makes the MLB different from any other major league in America like the NBA and NFL and that’s the minor league system. The MLB thrives on the minor league system and having teams be able to develop and grow a player’s game straight out of high school, so they are ready when it comes time for them to make the major league roster.\nThe Minor League Baseball League (MiLB) is currently made up of five different levels, Rookie, Low-A, High-A, Double-A, and Triple-A. Each MLB franchise has a team in each of these levels that is their affiliate where the franchise can move players up or down depending on their performance.\nThese different leagues are incredibly important for MLB teams’ long-term success, as strong player development allows prospects to make an impact in the majors more quickly. This also enables franchisees to benefit from rookie contracts, which are less expensive, allowing the front office to allocate money to other areas of the team.\nNow, the question is, what franchise has been the best at developing its players?\nThe franchises that have been the most successful at the Triple-A level since 2008 are the New York Yankees (1,276 total wins), Tampa Bay Rays (1,263 total wins), and Oakland A’s (1,237 total wins) in that order. When you think about it the top three do make sense, the Yankees who have the most wins since 2000 because of the combination of development and getting the best players, and two teams that rely on development to obtain wins.\n\n\nCode\nmilb &lt;- read_csv(\"milb.csv\")\n\nmilbtotal &lt;- milb |&gt; \n  arrange(Season) |&gt; \n  group_by(Aff) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    totalwins = sum(W),\n    totallosses = sum(L),\n    winpct = totalwins / (totalwins + totallosses)\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter(winpct &gt;= 0.5118214) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(winpct))\n\n\ndb &lt;- milbtotal |&gt; \n  filter(Aff == \"TBR\")\n\nmilbtotal |&gt;\n  select(Aff, totalwins, totallosses, winpct) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    Aff = \"Franchise\",\n    totalwins = \"Total Wins\",\n    totallosses = \"Toal Losses\",\n    winpct = \"Win Percentage\"\n  ) |&gt; \n   tab_header(\n    title = \"Tampa Bay minor league domination since 2008\",\n    subtitle = \"To sustain success at the MLB level it helps to have success at the minor league level and develop players to be ready to play in the majors.\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n    tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Trevor Darnell  |  **Source:** Baseball Reference\")\n  ) |&gt; \n    tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=18)\n     )\n   ) |&gt; \n    opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt; \n        fmt_percent(\n    columns = c(winpct),\n    decimals = 2\n  ) |&gt; \n    tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#092C5C\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"#8FBCE6\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Aff == \"TBR\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTampa Bay minor league domination since 2008\n\n\nTo sustain success at the MLB level it helps to have success at the minor league level and develop players to be ready to play in the majors.\n\n\nFranchise\nTotal Wins\nToal Losses\nWin Percentage\n\n\n\n\nNYY\n1276\n1007\n55.89%\n\n\nTBR\n1263\n1030\n55.08%\n\n\nOAK\n1237\n1049\n54.11%\n\n\nLAD\n1210\n1076\n52.93%\n\n\nCLE\n1197\n1089\n52.36%\n\n\nARI\n1193\n1092\n52.21%\n\n\nHOU\n1188\n1101\n51.90%\n\n\nPIT\n1180\n1109\n51.55%\n\n\nSTL\n1176\n1110\n51.44%\n\n\nMIL\n1167\n1105\n51.36%\n\n\n\nBy: Trevor Darnell | Source: Baseball Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, success in the MLB depends on the franchise you are talking about.

    "text": "The NHL is unique as it is a league that takes place in America but only 25% of the players in the league are from the USA, meanwhile, around 40% of the NHL is from Canada and there are 16 European countries represented too. In 2025 the NHL decided to highlight that instead of an All-Star game and have some of the best players from four countries (Canada, USA, Sweden, and Finland) represent their home country. Those countries played in a tournament called the Four Nations Face-Off. Overall, the tournament was a success and it garnered interest from sports fans who don’t normally watch hockey.\nDuring the broadcasts of this tournament, there was one defenseman on Team USA that they kept talking about, Jaccob Slavin. For Carolina Hurricanes fans, it was no surprise that the talk of the town was as they have known about its defensive ability for the 10 seasons he has been in the NHL and apart from the Canes franchise. On social media, though people seemed to be surprised by his presence on the ice and how much of an impact he had on the games. So why is that? Why is someone who the analyst said was one of the best defensemen in the Four Nations just now getting praise?\nOne of the reasons is that Slavin isn’t expected to score for the Hurricanes. The best way for fans to get to know players is who scores the goals for their team. For example, when NHL fans think of defensemen, especially the present day, the likes of Cale Makar and Roman Josi. Unsurprisingly, those two are near the top of the charts of defensemen goals since 2015 with Josi ranking first with 167 goals and Makar ranking seventh with 116 goals. Meanwhile, Salvo is around the middle of the pack of defensemen in that timeframe with 55 goals. So, it’s easy to see how he can slip through the cracks on players, especially when the NHL has started moving towards offensive defensemen which means those players are expected to contribute offensively just as much as everyone else on the ice.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nbasicstats &lt;- read_csv(\"nhl_players_skater_stats_15_25.csv\")\n\ntotals &lt;- basicstats |&gt; \n  group_by(player, team, pos) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    totalgoals = sum(g),\n    totalgames = sum(gp)\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter(totalgames &gt;= 300)\n\n\njs &lt;- totals |&gt; \n  filter(player == 'Jaccob Slavin')\n\ncm &lt;- totals |&gt; \n  filter(player == 'Cale Makar')\n\nrj &lt;- totals |&gt; \n  filter(player == 'Roman Josi')\n\ndefense &lt;- totals |&gt; \n  filter(pos == 'D')\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=defense, aes(x=totalgoals, y=team), color=\"darkgrey\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=js, aes(x=totalgoals, y=team), color=\"#CE1126\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=cm, aes(x=totalgoals, y=team), color=\"#6F263D\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=rj, aes(x=totalgoals, y=team), color=\"#FFB81C\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n      labs(\n    x=\"Total Goals\", \n    y=\"\", \n    title=\"Goal scorers get all the praise\", \n    subtitle=\"Defensemen in the NHL can easily go under many fans radar since their primary objective is not to score goals which is what fans care about.\",\n    caption=\"By Trevor Darnell | Source: Hockey Reference\"\n    ) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=js, aes(x=totalgoals, y=team, label=player), size = 3.5) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=cm, aes(x=totalgoals, y=team, label=player), size = 3.5) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=rj, aes(x=totalgoals, y=team, label=player), size = 3.5) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Slavin lacks in the scoring he makes up for is his defensive ability and hockey IQ. The Hurricanes alternate captain has been a menace on the defensive side of the ice as he ranks sixth amongst defensemen in a total of blocks and takeaways per game (around 2.6 per game). He also is smart with the puck in the offensive end as his difference in his defense stats just mentioned and turnovers per game are the sixth highest of defensemen.\n\n\nCode\nbasicstats &lt;- read_csv(\"nhl_players_skater_stats_15_25.csv\")\n\ndefensemen &lt;- basicstats |&gt; \n  filter(pos == 'D')\n\ntotalstats &lt;- defensemen|&gt; \n  group_by(player) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    totalgames = sum(gp),\n    totaldefense = sum(blk + take)/totalgames,\n    totalgiveaways = sum(give)/totalgames,\n    totaldifference = totaldefense - totalgiveaways\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter(totalgames &gt;= 200)\n\ntopten &lt;- totalstats |&gt; \n  filter(totaldifference &gt;= 1.907821)\n\njs &lt;- totalstats |&gt; \n  filter(player == 'Jaccob Slavin')\n\nck &lt;- totalstats |&gt; \n  filter(player == 'Cale Makar')\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=topten, \n    aes(y=reorder(player, totaldifference), x=totaldefense, xend=totalgiveaways),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"darkgreen\",\n    colour_xend = \"darkred\") +\n        labs(\n    x=\"Total Per Game\", \n    y=\"\", \n    title=\"The best defense focused defensemen since 2015\", \n    subtitle=\"If &lt;span style = 'color:darkgreen;'&gt;defensive plays&lt;/span&gt; is on the right then they contribute more on defense then hurt the teams offense.

Plus-minus is calculated by a player getting plus one point if he is on the ice while his team scores in an even-strength or shorthanded opportunity and minus one if he is on the ice during an opponent’s goal in an even strength or shorthanded. Slavin ranks fifth out of defensemen in his total plus-minus since 2015 (167, leading defenseman at 224). Where his impact is felt though is in expected plus minus which is created using statistical models to predict how many goals that player is expected to contribute for or against while on the ice. In expected plus minus the Canes top liner has the highest total (120.7) of a defenseman since 2015. Slavin’s total plus-minus and expected plus minus also is the highest (287.7) just edging out long-time Chicago Blackhawk, Devon Toews (287.1).\n\n\nCode\nadstats &lt;- read_csv(\"nhl_players_skater_advanced_stats_15_25.csv\")\nbasicstats &lt;- read_csv(\"nhl_players_skater_stats_15_25.csv\")\n\nbasicplusadvstats &lt;- basicstats |&gt;\n  select(-rk)|&gt; \n  rename(tm = team) |&gt; \n  inner_join(adstats)\n\ndefensemen &lt;- basicplusadvstats |&gt; \n  filter(pos == 'D')\n\nplusminus &lt;- defensemen |&gt; \n  group_by(player) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    Total_Plus_Minus = sum(x),\n    Total_Expected_Plus_Minus = sum(e),\n    games = sum(gp),\n    totalplusminus = sum(Total_Plus_Minus + Total_Expected_Plus_Minus)\n  ) |&gt;\n   filter(games &gt;= 200)\n\ntopplusminus &lt;- plusminus |&gt; \n  filter(totalplusminus &gt;= 192.6)\n\n\nplusminuslong &lt;- topplusminus |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(-player, -games, -totalplusminus), names_to = \"type\", values_to = \"value\", \n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=plusminuslong, aes(x=reorder(player,totalplusminus), weight=value, fill=type)) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"black\", \"red\")) +\n      labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Total +/-\", \n    title=\"Slavin relies on his defense to make him the most valuable defenseman in the NHL\", \n    subtitle=\"Despite not being a prolific goal scorer, Slavo has still made himself one of the most valuable defensemen in the NHL since 2015.\", \n    type = \"Total Expected +/-\", \"Total +/-\",\n    caption=\"Source: Hockey Reference | By: Trevor Darnell\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n    theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(size = 12.8, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size= 8), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile yes, Slavin’s ability to create turnovers and block shots is a big facet of his game, one of the most underrated parts of his game is his ability to stay on the ice and not place his team in bad situations in the form of committing penalties. Slavin is a two-time Lady Byng Award winner which is given to the player with the most sportsmanship and “gentlemanly conduct” which means didn’t commit many penalties. In his time in the NHL the Denver native averages .12 penalty minutes per game (leads defensemen the past 10 seasons), which means that he commits a standard two-minute penalty around once every 17 games. He does that while also eating up a lot of time on the ice, averaging over 22 minutes per game on the ice which is over a third of the game.\n\n\nCode\nbasicstats &lt;- read_csv(\"nhl_players_skater_stats_15_25.csv\")\n\nbasicplustoi &lt;- basicstats |&gt; \n  separate(toi, into=c(\"Minutes\", \"Seconds\"), sep=\":\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Minutes = as.numeric(Minutes), Seconds = as.numeric(Seconds)) |&gt; \n  mutate(sec = Seconds/60) |&gt; \n  mutate(TOI = Minutes + sec) |&gt; \n  mutate(aTOI = TOI / gp)\n\ndefensemen &lt;- basicplustoi |&gt; \n  filter(pos == 'D')\n\ndpm &lt;- defensemen |&gt; \n  group_by(player) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    totalgames = sum(gp),\n    pmpergame = sum(pim)/totalgames,\n    avgtoi = mean(aTOI)\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter(totalgames &gt;= 300,\n         pmpergame &lt;= 1.4225806)\n\njs &lt;- dpm |&gt; \n  filter(player == 'Jaccob Slavin')\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=dpm, aes(x=pmpergame, y=avgtoi), color = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=js, aes(x=pmpergame, y=avgtoi), color = \"#CE1126\") +\n      annotate(\"rect\", fill = \"blue\", alpha = 0.1, \n        xmin = -Inf, xmax = .25,\n        ymin = 22, ymax = 25) +\n   geom_vline(xintercept = 0.5308166) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 19.57455) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=.175, y= 25, label=\"High Time on Ice\\nLow Penalties\"), color=\"blue\", size = 3.5)+\n    geom_text(aes(x=.16, y=22, label=\"Jaccob Slavin\"), size = 3.5) +\n    labs(\n    x=\"Penalty minutes per game\", \n    y=\"Average time on ice\", \n    title=\"Slavin has contributed solid time on the ice without costing his team\", \n    subtitle=\"The Canes alternate captain has logged a high volume of valueable minutes since entering the league while committing very little penalties.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Hockey Reference | By: Trevor Darnell\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(size = 15.5, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size= 8), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, while the casual NHL fan might not know who Jaccob Slavin is or was just introduced to him during the Four Nations Face-Off, he has proven himself over his time in the league. He doesn’t get recognition sometimes since he doesn’t score the goals but he makes up for it with his stellar defensive ability and has cemented himself as one of the most underrated defensemen in the NHL."
